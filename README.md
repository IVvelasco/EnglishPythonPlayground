<h1>My Python Playground🐍, English version</h1>

A practical experiment with Python and VS Code in the Flatpak environment, in a Linux environment

<h3>📋 About the Project</h3>
I'm using an operating system that downloads applications (like VS Code) through Flathub (Flatpak format). The moment I opened VS Code, a .txt file appeared, informing me that this application is running inside a container and that some things might not work as expected...

This repository was born from an interesting challenge: testing the limits of VS Code running in a Flatpak container.
Mission: Write Python code until the IDE "breaks" - with an initial limit of 999 different codes (starting from 0).

<h3>🚀 Who is this repository for?</h3>
Python Beginners: Get Inspiration and Practical Examples
Linux/Flatpak Users: See How Different Codes Behave in the Environment
Curious: Follow This Unique Experiment
