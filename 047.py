# Using print line by line, even with punctuation to replace spaces, makes everything look jumbled.
# The solution was to turn each line into a single printout and use periods as spaces just to be safe.
# But tests show that spaces are respected when printing line by line.

print("#####..........#....#....####....#.......###......###......###......####.")
print("#..............#....#....#.......#......#...#.....#.......#...#....#....#")
